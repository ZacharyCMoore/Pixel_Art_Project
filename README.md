Pixel Art Project

This was the final project of the javascript section in Udacity's intro to programming nanodegree.
It is simple to use. After downloading it, open up the Pixel Art Maker HTML file.
After that, you can select the height and width of the table that will be created.
Then select a color and paint away.
